About
-----

Hi, I'm Brian Hicks. I'm a Web and Graphic design student at 
John Brown Univeristy planning to graduate in December of this year.
I built this site as part of the final class in my program. It has 
some of my student work on it, plus a little more if you look in 
my philosophy. As for the technical details, this site was built 
with Ruby on Rails. It hosts the image assets on Amazon S3 and uses 
jQuery for the front-end interaction. You can check out the source 
as well as more techical details of how I built the site here on Github.
